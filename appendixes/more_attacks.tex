\section{Additional Compound attacks}



\begin{comment}
%The linear skbs in mlx5 are mapping sh\_info as BI\_DIR, need to see when linear used vs non-linear and to check othe XDP drivers. When sh\_info is mapped BI\_DIR its all we need to attack.\newline It seems linear skb (No (HW?)LRO and MTU<1500 : verify with experimnt or Boris) means no frags, while \begin{enumerate}
%    \item build\_skb is used on a mapped page
%    \item page is unmapped in a deferred way, regardless of iommu policy; a driver hack.
%\end{enumerate} 
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item skb\_try\_coalesce
    \item SW LRO/GRO
\end{enumerate}.
