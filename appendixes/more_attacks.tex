\subsection{eXpress Data Path}\label{sec:xdp}

eXpress Data Path (XDP)~\cite{xdp} provides a way for users to add custom handling to RX buffers with little overhead. Common use cases include DDOS mitigation, forwarding and load balancing. To support the latter, the RX buffers are mapped with BIDIRECTIONAL access to the NIC. 

The tg3 driver does not support XDP. XDP support is usually added to high-speed NICs, such as ConnectX-4 (mlx5\_core). Accordingly, in this attack, we focus on the mlx5\_core driver, which, as mentioned in Sec, \ref{sec:forward}, does not unmap the RX buffers and reuses the pages using the page\_pool mechanism \cite{page_pool}. Subsequently, these pages are never unmapped, and remain accessible to the device for both reading and writing. 

The fact that the NIC has both read and write access to \shinfo, allows the NIC to execute an attack in 4 steps (Fig. \ref{fig:gro_xdp}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An RX TCP packet is generated. Then, the \shinfo{} is initialised by the driver and the \texttt{frags} are filled with NULL pointers. Finally, the packet is handed to the next layer.
    
    \item A second RX \skb{} is generated as part of the same TCP stream, initialized and also handed to the next layer.
    
    \item Both packets reach the GRO layer. Then, the second \skb{} is coalesced with the first packet, the \skb{} is freed and the \data{} is added as a \texttt{frag} to the first \skb.
    
    \item The NIC reads the updated \texttt{frag} field and translates the \page{} address to a valid \kva{}. Finally, the device fills the \texttt{destructor\_arg} field, creating a poisoned \skb{} (Fig. \ref{fig:sh_info}).
\end{enumerate}

The difference between this flow and a regular receive flow is the additional read capability the NIC has due to XDP. That is, the last step, where \means{} is obtained, is possible only due to the additional READ access.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Remark.} Other drivers that have XDP support, also tend to map RX buffers with BIDIRECTIONAL (e.g., bnxt, i40e, mlx4\_en). Interestingly, the mlx5\_core driver has two modes of operation: (1) linear - where an skb is built around an RX buffer and, (2) non-linear where the driver is filling up the \texttt{frags} of \shinfo, which was never mapped. The former is the default, and the later is actually secure. The non-linear mode is secure because \shinfo{} is \emph{never} accessible to the device. Thus the NIC never gains the \oportunity{} to attack.

\subsection{Forward Thinking}\label{sec:forward}

Packet forwarding is a standard Linux feature that allows a Linux machine to serve as a router or a load balancer. Packet forwarding functionality is usually disabled by default on Linux servers.

When this functionality is enabled, the NIC can independently generate an RX packet to a legitimate destination. This packet will then be forwarded to become a TX packet. However, unlike in the TCP layer that usually creates \skb{} packets with fragments, both the tg3 and the mlx5\_core drivers, usually create a linear \skb{}.

Namely, the drivers do not fill the \texttt{frags}, which the attacker uses to obtain \means{}. Both drivers, use the \texttt{napi\_gro\_receive} function to pass the \skb{} to the upper layer (this is the standard for most NIC drivers\footnote{Used by 98 NIC drivers, in Linux 5.0}). 

In this case, the upper layer is the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) layer \cite{gro}. GRO attempts to aggregate multiple TCP segments into a single large packet. Specifically, GRO converts multiple linear \skb{} buffers (belonging to a single TCP stream) into a single \skb{} with multiple fragments. This \skb{} then traverses the Linux network stack and becomes a TX packet. The attacker can use this TX packet as described in the previous attack (Fig. \ref{fig:payload}).

Packet forwarding, also opens up an additional attack option. An attacker might be interested in persistent surveillance rather than overtaking the machine. 

Packet forwarding allows the NIC to inspect arbitrary pages at will. 
Instead of sending a TCP packet and letting the GRO layer fill in the \texttt{frags} information, the NIC can generate a small UDP packet and fill in the \texttt{frags} array with any arbitrary \page{} addresses within the system. This results in the mapping of these pages by the driver, providing READ access to any page in the system to the NIC. Both the mlx5\_core and tg3 drivers map all the frags in \shinfo{} without verifying the actual packet length.

To avoid detection and, more importantly, preserve OS stability, the device must undo the changes to \shinfo{} before creating a TX completion. That is, before letting the CPU know that the packet was sent and its buffer can now be freed. Otherwise, the OS will try freeing the pages, indicated by \shinfo.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Remark.} Having an accomplice in the form of an unprivileged user provides an additional vectors of attack. In addition to running ROP attacks, the NIC can also leak the content of arbitrary memory pages to the user. Assuming that the NIC has WRITE access to \shinfo{} after it has been sent up the network stack (for example, in case of deferred protection or when page\_pool is used, Sec. \ref{sec:xdp}), the NIC can modify the \page{} address in the \texttt{frag} entries, letting the Linux network stack copy the context of arbitrary memory pages to an unprivileged user. A likely side effect of this attack is memory corruption and Kernel panic, so caution is advised. The reason being, that the \texttt{skb\_free} function attempts to free pages never owned by the network stack.
