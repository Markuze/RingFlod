In this work we present a conceptual framework, for privilege escalation attacks, by DMA capable devices.
We focus on the most popular OS; coincidentally; w/o any known DMA attacks against it. We define, MMO in the context of DMA attacks; a schema to analyze DMA vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that DMA attacks go beyond trivial exploits in the presence of bad DMA hygiene. DMA vulnerabilities are a direct result of systematic disregard to DMA risks; resulting in APIs that make it a challenge to write a device driver that is not security liability. We focus on network devices, because these devices inherently, are easier to control remotely. But, the bad hygiene and the risks described are not limited to networking; as we show with the FireWire driver. DMA attacks are harder than it may seem; a malicious device with DMA access; can wreck havoc on existing systems. But, the triviality of the reported attacks; where a single buggy design choice compromises a system; is actually, a bane to security. In this work, we show that executing a DMA attack is not necessarily trivial, even when the attacker has unprivileged access. We show, that in order to execute a DMA and attacker must have all three out of \means,\motivation and \oportunity. On the one hand gaining all three is non trivial, which may cause a false sense of security; and on the other the pursuit, of all needed ingredients reveals a deep-seated disregard for DMA vulnerabilities. Previous works have resulted in local fixes, but not the adaptation of holistic solutions. We demonstrate how, even, when one layer of the network stack is trying to behave securely, it will often be subverted by a different layer of the same OS. We farther, show how a bad API inevitably leads to a compromised OS, and poor design choices. Ours is the first work to propose a schema for understanding DMA attacks, revealing the danger to be innate to DMA devices rather than just a set of anecdotal security flaws.}
