\section{Appendix A}

\subsection{All contributions made in Gils work \cite{gil}}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Sub Page] Exploiting the sub page vulnerability to access metadata.
\item[Deferred protection] Exploiting IOTLB invalidation to hack correct NIC drivers.
\item[KASLR] Reading random ptrs to guess the random address bits, Leaking data via Sub Page.
\item[FreeBSD UMA] Hacking FreeBSD memory allocator.
\item[\texttt{Question RDMA}] Can IPoIB driver be exploited in additional ways? Other RDMA issues.
\end{description}

\subsection{All contributions made in NDSS paper\cite{thunder}:}
\begin{description}
\item[attack 1,2] Windows attacks, irrelevant.
\item[attack 3] MAC OS reading VPN data, irrelevant.
\item[attack 4] Shared mappings between devices: MAC OS (Also Windows)mbufs open to read/write - Same as Gils  attack \#1 on thunderbolt.
\item[attack 5] FreeBSD per device iommu:  Same as Gils  attack \#1 on thunderbolt (p.9). Mention that Linux is invulnerable.
\item[attack 6] Linux leaks nat tables - random subpage hits - No known IOVA, NO way of knowing as READ=!Write
\item[attack 7] Linux leaking data by avoiding TX completions - would hit T/O issues and driver restart.
\item[attack 8] ATS - Self serve IOMMU by NIC. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Shared contributions:}
\begin{description}
\item[Sub Page] Shared Mdata - Data mapping.
\item[KALSR] KASLR leaking due to sub page.
\end{description}

\subsection{New Contribution}

\begin{description}
\item[skb shared info] Shared Mdata in Linux skb. 
\item[page cahe colocation] RX data allocated from page cache - means that after unmap page is still accessible via iova of next buffer - (strict and deferred vulnerable). This is stronger then sub page, as dense mappings 
allow for an attack even with strict API and correct ordering.
\item[RingFlod] Determining PFNs for attack. \texttt{What else is accessible by the NIC, what config, FW return codes/values? - Is kva visible}.
\item[HOTPage] A TX page reused in RX - allowing for temp R/W access with open valid kva (zero knowledge)-- \texttt{I'm pretty sure overlap is impossible and this approach is invalid}.
